# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines: attempting to group by a non-existent field.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code.

## Description

The original code attempts to perform a group operation on a field that doesn't exist in the documents. This often results in an empty or unexpected result set, rather than a clear error message. 

## Solution

The solution ensures the field used in the `$group` stage actually exists in the collection's documents.  It also includes error handling to check for the existence of the field.
